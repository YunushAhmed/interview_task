Participants, who like their data classified and have developed their own mental taxonomy will naturally want to organize the posts they care about in ways that make sense to them.  Providing them with this functionality, no matter what their role in the site can benefit the rest of the community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo classification can happen at any level, administrator, author or registered reader.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAn administrator can set a recommended taxonomy, meaning that the administrator optionally defines the keywords or hierarchy.  This helps define the direction and scope of the community.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs an author submits a post, he/she has the option to choose subject categories.  If they don\u0027t categorize the post, it is left in a \u0027catch-all\u0027 bucket.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERegistered readers can categorize posts.  I see this as a basic bookmark type function.  \u0022Hmm.  I like this post and want to be able to find it again.  I\u0027ll add it to my bookmarks\u0022 When the user goes to bookmark the post, drupal returns a list of categories with the post in the author\u0027s category.  The reader can then file it in the same category as the author, or use one of the predefined categories or create a new category.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonal bookmarks categories are then \u0027averaged\u0027 and shared with the rest of the community.  If a reader bookmarks a post in \u0022category3\u0022, the next reader to bookmark that post sees that information along with the authors categorization and can choose to use either or create a new category.  The most popular categorization for a post is used for the public directory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWriting this, I see it would be ridiculously complex to code and would probably be confusing to users.  However, it provides a ton of flexibility and was fun to think about.  Maybe it will give the group some useful ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EReading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact man.\u003C/i\u003E - Francis Bacon\u003C/p\u003E",

        "value": "\u003Cp\u003EYOUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION\u003Cbr /\u003E\nj0e and poolar, I read your past discussion and think you are on the right track. I wonder about user-generated categories. I see the value of letting users select subject headings based on the predefined subject taxonomy. But users adding categories to the taxonomy interests and troubles me at the same time. So I would propose separating any new user-contributed subjects from the taxonomy. Perhaps a system to request a subject be added could go to the moderators? I don\u0027t know. Here\u0027s some further thoughts on this topic based on previous untested work I\u0027ve done.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EVALUE OF USER-GENERATED INDEXING\u003Cbr /\u003E\nA while ago, I wrote \u003Ca href=\u0022http://studioid.com/studio/articles/vri/\u0022 rel=\u0022nofollow\u0022\u003Ea database definition document that proposed a system for indexing images\u003C/a\u003E. The paper suggested an access point that used user-generated keywords. This is similar to what you are suggesting here and I am very interested in this type of categorization because it might add value to individual users.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESEPARATE USER KEYWORDS RATHER THAN NODES IN THE SUBJECT TAXONOMY\u003Cbr /\u003E\nj0e\u0027s idea of using bookmarks is right on the money. It is similar to the idea I suggest in the paper of user-generated index terms/descriptors. The concept was borrowed from the Information Retrieval literature (I can\u0027t remember where) and I have not been able to find any literature/research that suggests that this is valuable. But I am interested in a proposal of this sort that is somehow related to the hierarchical subject taxonomy that we are discussing above, but  is not exactly a part of it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think j0e is suggesting that the bookmarks/keywords would be separated from the subject taxonomy, is that right? I chose the word \u0022keywords\u0022 rather than saying that the user-generated descriptions would go in the subject headings is because I think it would be better to have this kind of data fall into an alphanumeric listing of index terms rather than be part of the subject taxonomy. Therefore it would be separated physically in the database, but would be joined back with subject headings somehow in the presentation. What I envisioned at the time was a displayed index that allows you to browse by subject headings OR browse by user descriptors -- they would not be grouped together on screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this getting hard to follow? It might be because the models I followed were Print Indexes like the Bibliography of the History of Art and the Modern Language Association Index. I was attempting to describe a way of taking the immense strength of the presentation in these indexes and transform it into electronic format. Some of this is very relevant to Drupal.\u003C/p\u003E",

I think Polaar mentioned this somewhere but can\u0027t find it to give proper credit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAs jibbajabbaboy said, the user taxonomies could be kept seperate from the administrators taxonomy so the administrators taxonomy stays clean and uncluttered.\n\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI was thinking of some sort of ranking though, where a shared taxonomy is self managed by \u0022normal selfish user behavior\u0022.  To be honest I don\u0027t really know how it would work, but here is a really rough sketch.\n\u003Cp\u003EJohn posts an article, and stores it in his own bookmarks with a new category name.  Bill reads the article, decides to bookmark.  When he bookmarks it, he see\u0027s a list of all categories, with the John\u0027s new category name highlighted and at the top of the list.  It is at the top and highlighted because there is a good chance that Bill will share John\u0027s opinion about categorization.  Let\u0027s say bill disagrees and puts it under one of the pre-existing categories.  Now Jeff bookmarks it, both Bill and John\u0027s categories are highlighted and at the top of the list. Whichever category that has been chosen the most for this post takes top spot.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what a user see\u0027s when bookmarking a post.  But what does the rest of the viewing audience see?  They see a \u0022public directory\u0022 that sorts and ranks all the posts and categories based on the user bookmarks.  So John\u0027s post might start off categorized in a misc bucket, because John\u0027s new category is still unproven.  However, if enough people use John\u0027s category, it then becomes accepted into the public hierarchy, and the post is listed in that category.   As soon as Bill categorizes the post in a standard category, the post will also be listed there.  \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESince the act of bookmarking can be viewed as a metric of value, we could use that info.  Each category in the hierarchy is a rank order list of postings and one of the ranking attributes is how many times it was bookmarked into that category.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI must sound like the guy on the street corner drinking out of a paper bag.  But unfortunately, I can\u0027t use drugs or alcohol as an excuse for my ramblings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBTW, I think I\u0027ll take Polaar\u0027s advice and keep future pie-in-the-sky ramblings on drop.org and leave drupal.org for serious reality based discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EReading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact man.\u003C/i\u003E - Francis Bacon\u003C/p\u003E",

I think we should all avoid that question in any case and just design what we think WE will want to use. Whether someone can code this is another issue. I wish had chosen Computer Science instead of Art History when I went to undergrad!

I am good at english, but some of the words used are just beyond my imediate knowledge so I end up using a dictionary at times. Also I am more into how to get something to work at the moment. So I think in terms of this is what they want, now how do I code it. Which in this discussion is a dissadvatage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt some point someone should do a summary for normal people to understand.
